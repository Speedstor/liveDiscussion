A `C` program that send and receives tcp packets from raw sockets. 

This can be used for a reference for making custom network protocols given the structure. In addition, the main purpose of this program is to have detailed **time recordings** of individual packets w/ `-r`.

*"On a side note"*, this program only runs on **linux** and linux only, I'm sorry :(.
<br/><br/><br/>

## :green_circle: Quick Start
1. Download the stable release [canvasBot.zip](https://github.com/Speedstor/liveDiscussion/releases/tag/stable) here. 
2. Unzip the folder
3. go into the folder and run the `commands` below
```bash
linux / mac
$ sudo java -jar ./canvasBot.jar

windows
PS C:\dir\path> java -jar ./canvasBot.jar
```
<br/>

### ! Need to know

The source code is not updated to the jar excutable in the stable release. I've lost the source code to that. So if you want the updated source code, you would have to use java decompile to get it, sorry :(.
